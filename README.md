# humpty-numpy-A3

How to run the program:

1. Using Pycharm or your favorite IDE, select which version of the Naive Bayes classifier to run first, the choices being NB-BOW-FV 
(Naive Bayes classifier with a filtered vocabulary) and NB-BOW-OV (Naive Bayes classifier with the original unmodified vocabulary).

2. Run all cells in the file then consult the A3_Output file to view the evaluation and trace file.

3. (Optional) If you want to modify the smoothing applied to the original or filtered vocabulary, add the smoothing value as the last argument of the function *predict* where it is called in the Jupyter notebook files. The default smoothing value is **0.01**.
