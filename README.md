# humpty-numpy-A3

How to run the program:

1. Using Pycharm or your favorite IDE, select which version of the Naive Bayes classifier to run first, the choices being NB-BOW-FV 
(Naive Bayes classifier with a filtered vocabulary) and NB-BOW-OV (Naive Bayes classifier with the original unmodified vocabulary).

2. Run all cells in the file then consult the A3_Output file to view the evaluation and trace file.

3. (Optional) If you want to modify the smoothing applied to the filtered vocabulary, go to the codebase.py file, find the predict function and
enter the smoothing value of your choice. Run the codebase, go back to the NB-BOW-OV file add the smoothing value as a prefix to the file name
and re-run all the code cells.
